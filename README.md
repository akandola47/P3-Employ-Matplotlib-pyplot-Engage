Web Mining and Applied NLP (44-620)
Matplotlib and pyplot
Student Name:
Perform the tasks described in the Markdown cells below. When you have completed the assignment make sure your code cells have all been run (and have output beneath them) and ensure you have committed and pushed ALL of your changes to your assignment repository.

Every question that requires you to write code will have a code cell underneath it; you may either write your entire solution in that cell or write it in a python file (.py), then import and run the appropriate code to answer the question.

Do not use other external modules except matplotlib and pyplot (e.g. math, etc) for this assignment unless you are explicitly instructed to, though you may use built in python functions (min, max, etc) as you wish.

For all of these questions, your plots must have an appropriate title and labeled axes. Use the Matplotlib documentation as necessary to guide you through these exercises.
